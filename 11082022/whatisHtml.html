    <p>
        Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.
    </p>

    <p>Hypertext is text which contains <a href="#">links</a>
        to other texts. The term was coined by <a href="#">Ted Nelson</a>
        around 1965 (see <a href="#">History</a>
        ).</p>

    <p>HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and
        <a href="#"> sound </a>, for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.
    </p>

    <p>Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.</p>
